# CubeBuilderGame
This is a Cube Builder Game that I made with OpenGL! I had some help from https://learnopengl.com/, which has been an amazing learning resource. I did the testing using googleTesting framework.

Demo video can be found here:

Need to link with the following external libraries for it to work: glfw, dl, gtest, assimp.
