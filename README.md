# CubeBuilderGame
This is a Cube Builder Game made with OpenGL! Well, a demo of the game. There is still lots of work and ideas that I have for it.
The 3 key components that are coming along well are:
1) Placing and removing cubes
2) Ability to generate large maps
3) Sky colors change based on the time of day and the position of the sun

Need to link with the following external libraries for it to work: glfw, dl, gtest, assimp.
